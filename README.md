# Uses the mems accelerometer to control the movement of a robot.The x and y values obtained from the accelerometer are scaled to provide appropriate PWM pulse lengths for the actuation of the two servo motors involved.
The delay is obtained using for loops which have been calibrated to provide the delay required for PWM.
